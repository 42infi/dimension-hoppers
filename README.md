#movement
- w_a_s_d keys for movement

#some comments
- networking was made in a rush and would probably be considered bad practice to have no server side validation
- key inputs break when caps lock is active
- game looks a bit unpolished in my opinion
- mouse has some inputlag
- its super easy to cheat but i wont publish a browser anti cheat for free lol
